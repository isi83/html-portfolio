<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Israfil Akman. I am 41 years old now and learn web development in depth. I study Applied Computer Science.</p>

<p>My hobbys are sports, amongst which are fitness training and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I am a member in a local makerspace to learn practical skills like cutting wood, but also in electronics and programming. Besides I like to learn whole new things, I regard myself as a life-long learner. On the other hand, to get inspired and to refresh my mind I watch series and films, mostly streaming.</p>

<p>If you like to contact me, do not hesitate.</p>
