<h1>The Best Movies According to Israfil</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>John Wick 2</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie, i usually hate action movies, but this represents a
  sub-genre called Gun-Fu. I like the second part most because of the story and 
the unexpected twist at the end of the film.</p>

<h3>Blade Runner (1983)</h3>
<p>This is a really cool sci-fi movie. I have seen it last year, but I played the 
  computer game back then in the 90s. The cyberpunk-like setting, awesome. The movie also 
  awesome. The remake is not that good, also to long I guess.

<h3>Matrix</h3>
<p>Again, a sci-fi movie, I like the underlying story, also related 
  to the simulation hypothesis. The action (Gun-Fu) scenes are awesome.
  I could watch it over and over.</p>
